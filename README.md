OVERVIEW
==================
This project was created for CS-3100 at Utah State University. The purpose of the assignment is to demonstrate
how paging work in an operating system. The project offers a simulation into how paging functions, creating
a variety of sequences and page references, then iterating through these references and sequence to detail the total
number of page faults. The project then determines whether Belady's anomaly (the phenomenon in which increasing the number
of page frames results in an increase in the number of page faults) occurs.
